	This is the Guile WWW library, a set of Guile Scheme
	modules to facilitate HTTP, URL and CGI programming.

Installation
============
(See file INSTALL for generic installation instructions.)

	Briefly, you need to issue these standard commands:

	  ./configure [options]
	  make
	  make check [var=val ...]   # optional, but recommended
	  make install

	Doing "make check" tests the ‘load’ability of the modules, first
	individually, then all together (sumo), then does some specific
	tests to make sure things are somewhat ok.  Influential variables:

	  GUILE           -- the interpreter to use [guile]
	  DEBUG           -- if "1", display progress information,
			     and invoke guile with option ‘--debug’
	  VERBOSE         -- if "1", set ‘%load-verbosely’, and
			     enable some tests to display more info

	If "make check" fails, please report the problem (see below).

	On "make install", these files are copied to these directories
	(creating them first if necessary), renaming each FOO.scm to
	simply FOO, and compressing them somewhat:

	  source/*            -- $(GUILE_LIBSITE)/www (and subdirs)
	  doc/guile-www.info  -- $(prefix)/info

	Normally $(GUILE_LIBSITE) is $(prefix)/lib/guile/site (Guile 1.4.x)
                                  or $(prefix)/share/guile/site (other Guile)
	     and $(prefix)        is /usr/local

	For guile to resolve these module names as (www FOO), make sure
	that $(GUILE_LIBSITE) is in the ‘%load-path’.  To see the value of
	this variable use the command:

	  guile -c '(display %load-path)'

	For systems which have the "guile-tools make-module-catalog"
	program, "make install" also updates the module catalog in
	$(GUILE_LIBSITE).
